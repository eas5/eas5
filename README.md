- 👋 Hi, I’m Elvys Soares, or @eas5
- 👀 I’m interested in test automation with JUnit
- 🌱 As a PhD student at the Informatics Center (CIn) of Federal University of Perbambuco (UFPE) - Brazil, I’m currently researching about test smells, theis effects on automated tests and strategies to mitigate or eliminate them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with automated test suites, where I can assess developers opinions about automatic test cases design and implementation.
- 📫 You're welcome to reach me at eas5@cin.ufpe.br
